# Evil Manager - Dynamic Form Application

A comprehensive form application built with React and Vite, featuring dynamic form generation with robust validation. This project demonstrates modern React patterns and form handling techniques.

## 🚀 What I Built

I've created a dynamic form builder that includes:

- **User Registration Form** with comprehensive validation

- **Real-time Form Validation** with custom error messages
- **Responsive Design** that works on all device sizes
- **Custom Validation Logic** for complex scenarios

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18+ with Hooks
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **State Management**: React useState for form state
- **Styling**: CSS3 with responsive design principles
- **Form Handling**: Custom form validation logic
- **Development Environment**: Node.js with npm/yarn
